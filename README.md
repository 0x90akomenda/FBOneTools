# BFBC2 Toolkit

A collection of tools for the Frostbite 1 Engine. 
Supports Battlefield: Bad Company, Bad Company 2 and 1943.

For now you will need to build the tool on your own. 
A proper build will be released on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/battlefieldbadcompany2/mods/) soon.

# Credits

* Heico - Author of BFBC2 Toolkit
* [Frankelstner](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?/profile/6706-frankelstner/) - For his Python scripts that handle .fbrb & .dbx files. Without his work in the BF Community my tools would not be possible! 
* [Napisal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcx-pztQ3rGfO3pbcd52OQ) & [bad .baubau](https://www.youtube.com/user/cssbaubau) - for all the time they invested to figure out how Frostbite works. Without them I would not even know about BFBC2 modding.
* [Danny Becket](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1563422/danny-beckett) - For providing the code of his IniFile class, which my tool uses to handle ini files.
* [DICE](https://www.dice.se/) & [EA](https://www.ea.com/) - For the Frostbite Engine and game series "Battlefield".
* [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) - For the development environment "Visual Studio".
