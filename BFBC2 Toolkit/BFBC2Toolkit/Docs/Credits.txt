*BFBC2 Toolkit*

//Credits

-Frankelstner﻿ for his Python script which packs the .fbrb archive. Without his work in the BF Community "BFBC2 Toolkit" would not be possible! 
-Napisal﻿ & bad .baubau﻿ for all the time they invested to figure out how Frostbite works. Without them I would not even know about BFBC2 modding.
-Danny Beckett﻿ for providing the code of his IniFile﻿ class, which my tool uses to handle ini files.
-Icons8﻿ for providing several icons, which my tool uses for some buttons.*
